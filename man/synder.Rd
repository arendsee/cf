\title{synder: Trace intervals between genomes}
\description{
A synteny map is a set of linked intervals between two genomes. The primary
function of Synder is to use a synteny map to trace an interval in one
genome to a narrow search space on another genome.
}
\details{
The main functions exported by Synder are

\itemize{
  \item search - map intervals in A to search intervals in B
  \item anon_search - simplified version of search
  \item filter - find links that agree with a synteny map
  \item map - find intervals in B that overlap intervals in A
  \item count - count links in A overlapping given intervals
  \item dump - dump synteny map with added contiguous set ids
}

Synder also defines several classes. These all have specialized plot and
print functions.

\itemize{
   \item synmap
   \item gff
   \item hitmap
   \item dump_result
   \item search_result
   \item filter_result
   \item map_result
   \item count_result
}
}
