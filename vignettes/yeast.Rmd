Synder traces orthology independent of sequence similarity. This allows unique
mappings of sequences even when they are members of large families.

The `ty1` dataset includes synteny maps built between *S. cerivisiae* and 8
other yeast species. These maps were built using mummer.

```r
data(ty1)
```

```
results <- lapply(ty1$synmaps, function(x) search(x, ty1$gff))

sa <- results$Saccharomyces_arboricola
```

Now we want to infer orthology independent of sequence similarity. So I will
subtract the query intervals from the synteny maps.


```
maps <- lapply(ty1$synmaps, function(x) map(x, ty1$gff))
```
